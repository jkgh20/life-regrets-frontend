Don't waste it on the wrong person.",
  "Not going out, not meeting girls. No matter how spoiled I know they are (at least where I come from), I'd still be getting some. Probably it's because I had confidence issues, or maybe it's because I don't drink. Now, I ended up with a long distance girlfriend who i'm still to meet, who I have an opinion doesn't try so hard to meet me, while I'm desperate on finding a job.",

  "Seriously, never go after the money. It's not worth it, fuck I hate my job.",
  "Spending most of my life obsessing over my weight. Seriously there are so many things that I either never did because I was \"too fat\" or put off until I could lose x number of pounds. Dieting instead of living my life. Secondly but related, staying in bad relationships because fat me couldn't possibly get another man.",
  "Not moving out of my small town of 6,000 people. I got comfortable and put down roots here. Really wish I would have moved somewhere with more opportunities. I was going to join the Coast Guard at the same time as a buddy of mine but I backed out because of a girl (who ended up dumping me a year later) and he joined anyway. He lives all the way across the country in Washington. He's retired at 40 and works part time.",

  "Having wasted ten years on Reddit.",
  "Going on vacation and leaving my recently sober twin brother at my house alone. I knew something was wrong when he wouldn't answer the phone. Found him face down in my living room. It's been 9 months and I still can't close my eyes without seeing my best friend alone on the ground. His phone was 2 foot away and he couldn't answer it because he was already gone.",
  "Few years back I started to date my best friend. A couple months in it was clear it wasn't going to work out, I was moody and emotional back then, and she had some personal issues.

  "Picking up smoking cigarettes. It's the one thing I just can't go without. Sense of smell is pretty much gone. Taste isn't as strong as it was. And it's pretty expensive. I smoke Newports which are on average $6.50 a pack. Pack a day that's close to $200 a month. For what? Decreased senses. Increased chances of serious health problems. Smoking is a bitch",
  "Not sending my dog to the vet on Saturday. He was really sick, but my family and I figured he would recover if we gave him meds and helped him out, because it worked before. If he didn't get better, we'd take him to the vet on Monday. I found his lifeless body Sunday at 7 AM.",
  "Eating a marshmallow while high on acid. Worst decision of my life.",
  "The fact that I've never put myself in a place were I could really thrive, and just blame it on the world being unfair.",
  "Never living in the moment. There is a tendency for people to be so focused on what possibilities the future holds that they lose sight of the opportunities right in front of them. I am in my third year of college now and I have numerous regrets for not being proactive to create lasting friendships and memories because I was and still am focused on my education and GPA.",
  "Not taking better care of my body when I was younger. I thought I was invincible and put my body through hell working out and probably not with good form. Now I have discs that'll forever bother me in my spine because of it. I miss the days of being pain free and all it would have taken was discipline and not thinking I was a superhero nor that my body wouldn't catch up to me eventually.",
  "Having an affair with a married man. I'm a good person, except that. I was young and a fucking idiot.",
  "Sleeping with a drunk persistent friend, I didn't want to, just because he wouldn't leave me alone while staying at my house. I had a big day at work the next day and thought the only way I'd ever get to sleep was if I just fucked him so he'd pass out and leave me alone. Condom broke. Things did not end well for me.",
  "I finished college and gave up my dream career to move home and take care of my ailing father. It cost me my future, and now I'm stuck in a bullshit factory job because I can't find anything better. It pays the bills and feeds my kid, that's all that matters. I spent thousands of dollars I didn't have, and three years of my life to escape the auto industry and here I am. At a slightly better auto parts factory job.",
  "I fucked up the best relationship I'll ever have. She loved me to death and would do anything for me. But for some reason I wasn't happy, I broke up with her and half a year later I realized what I had and what I messed up. But she was happy with another man and I was left heartbroken. If I could go back and change it I so would.",
  "Hurting my husband (then boyfriend) at the beginning of our relationship. I didn't know what or who I wanted and just messed around way too much but he never gave up on me. I face every day knowing that nothing he could ever do to me would ever pay me back for everything I've put him through.",
  "I wish I would have stopped and saw my grandmother more. I don't have many regrets but this is the biggest. I used to pass by her house to my friends and girlfriends all the time and never stopped in. Either I was going to party or get laid and that was way morre important than stopping to see if she needed anything, or just to say hi. She was in her middle 80's and loved her grandkids. Even for 5 minutes or to have a cup of tea or play a hand of rummy with her, dammit, now I pissed at myself again. What a wonderful, hardworking woman. I tell my kids about this regret and to please just stop and say hi to their grandparents.",
  "All the sexual things I did with men I wasn't in a relationship with. They disappeared after they got what they wanted. I was young and inexperienced but it is still my biggest regret.",
  "I haven't mustered the strength to end it",
  "Spending too much time and energy on a relationship I knew was doomed to fail and then spending too much time and energy on mourning the failure of said relationship.",
  "I was going to become a cardiologist but I wanted to travel the world and have kids and didn‚Äôt want endure such a long training period. Now I‚Äôm in my 30s and no kids, no cardiologist salary, but I have travelled the world. Guess 1 out of 3 isn‚Äôt too bad!",
  "The biggest regret I have from my twenties is that I didn't develop any long lasting friendships in college. I had a lot of friends, and a ton of acquaintances, but there's not a single [person I know from my twenties that I still speak with and I really wish there were.",
  "I wasted an entire year of my life living in my parent's basement, working a shitty job, being an alcoholic and pretty much not talking to anyone socially. One day I woke up, packed up my car and moved halfway across the country to crash with a friend in a new city. Pretty much saved my life.",
  "Focusing too much on my career and not enough on friends and relationships. I have a great career and the financial stability to go places and do things, but no one to do them with because I was a workaholic and ignored my social life",
  "Dropping out of college when I did. I was on track in the early/mid 2000s to graduate with a degree in education (and was working briefly as a sub/classroom assistant at a middle school), but for some foolish reason I dropped out. I did eventually go back, but by then I graduated in 2010 after the economy crashed and all the school districts started laying off. I never did get a full time teaching position after that.",
  "I had a child in my 20s which I don't regret, but I do wish I traveled more before having said child.",
  "Not traveling to places while I can. Married with a kid now and travelling isnt really an option nowadays.",
  "I'm actually pretty satisfied with how my twenties played out. My biggest regret is staying in a job I hated for too long.",
  "Not going into therapy sooner.",
  "I wish I'd moved further away, and travelled more. I also wish I'd recognized that I had super fucking toxic friends and that I needed to drink less booze and hang out with better people.",
  "I wasted too much time looking back. Don't look back, keep moving forwards",
  "Not living abroad. I have a great career and life now. But I can't help but feel like the opportunity for me to live in a different country has passed.",

  "I regret that I didn't save more money for my retirement.",
  "not taking more chances on everything but instead holding back and playing everything safe, especially with career and relationships.",
  "Spent too much fucking time playing video games instead of interacting with my wife. Almost got divorced ever the original Everquest.",
  "I regret all the time I spent at work in a field I hate. I'm still doing it and it has ruined my life. Few friends, fewer lovers and since the bubble I've even had to give up/cut back on a lot of the 'stuff' I acquired/enjoyed that was supposed to offset the soul sucking nature of my career.",
  "I should have had more hookups and enjoyed being young and carefree. Instead I was on work travel, sleeping alone in endless hotels.",
  "Graduate school. Complete waste of time and money.",
  "I regret any computer job I had. for me, the PC/software job was a soul sucking experience. I wish I did something more physical and gratifying.",
  "I know it's not as major as some of the other things here, but I think I'm studying the wrong thing in life. I let myself get bullied by family into going to university for the sciences, when really I want to do the arts. I've almost got my degree and I seem to regret it more every day",
  "Failing out of college. Didn‚Äôt even know what I wanted to do, but at least I could have just waited. Instead, I went and ruined it. Now I‚Äôm 25 and feel like I‚Äôm going to be stuck doing shit, low paying jobs the rest of my life. My little debt I did accrue from college is almost paid off, but how the hell can i go back now? I can‚Äôt work full time and go to classes for 4 years.",
  "I ruined things beyond repair with a woman I love. I had so many chances to really show her how I felt and I fucked them all up. She doesn't want to be close to me at all anymore, and I can't stop thinking about her. I have to struggle to keep it together at work, I cry every night, I constantly think about how she used to smile at me, the way her eyes shone when she was looking up at me, the feeling of her lips on mine. I lost all of that and will never have it again, and it feels like a physical weight I can't escape.",
  "Drinking and smoking weed from 14 to 27. Other people do this and are just kind of slackers, but it exacerbated latent mental health issues that went undiagnosed and untreated for years. Now I‚Äôm almost 30, a year sober and realizing How could have been a good person and successful if I hadn‚Äôt self medicated all those years, but instead I‚Äôm trying to start my life for the first time and feeling like I‚Äôm too old and screwed up to carve out a piece of comfort and safety."
